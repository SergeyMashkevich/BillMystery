Three friends sit down at a café, enjoying their time together. The bill arrives, but in a twist of events, they decide to keep it a secret if one of them has paid—or if no one has at all. The challenge? They must figure out if someone settled the bill, but without revealing who it was, keeping everyone in the dark about the details. <br>
The game revolves around a simple but clever process inspired by cryptographic principles.
